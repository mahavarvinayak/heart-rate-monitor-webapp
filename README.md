# Heart Rate Monitor Web Application

## Project Overview
A sophisticated web application designed to monitor and estimate heart rate using anthropometric data including height, weight, and body size measurements. The application aims to provide accurate heart rate predictions with up to 97% precision using advanced machine learning algorithms.

## Project Goals
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for heart rate monitoring
- Achieve up to 97% accuracy in heart rate estimation
- Utilize anthropometric data (height, weight, body size) for personalized predictions
- Provide real-time heart rate analysis and visualization
- Create a responsive, accessible web application
